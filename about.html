<p>Hello! <br>My name is Danielle Vann. I am a student at IUPUI majoring in Computer Information Technology with a concentration in Software Development.When I am not studying, I enjoy being creative. Some of my current creative outlets include, playing my viola, painting, cooking, crocheting, and baking! Although I am passionate about many things, the two things I am very passionate about is my faith and my family. I am fortunate enough to have a close bond with my mom, sister, uncle, aunt, and cousins. I am also a fur-parent to a six year old cat, Rudy, that has one eye and a tongue that falls out of her mouth at times.</p>
